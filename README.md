# Responsive Flex Layout
The default is the 'mobile' layout, aka when the width of the viewport is less than 641px. In this layout, the boxes stack on top of each other at full width. Box 1 is pink, Box 2 is red, Boxes 3 and 4 are hidden. 
When the viewport is detected to have a width of 641 px or higher, the layout changes to the column layout, where each box now has a different background colour and is shown side-by-side, as columns, at the same width.
The container does not expand past 1140px, if you resize the page beyond that you get empty space on either side of the website.
